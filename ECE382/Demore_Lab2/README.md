# Lab #2 - Cryptography

## By C2C Mark Demore II

 
### Objectives or Purpose 
The purpose of this lab was to experiment with the various ways of accessing and using memory, as well as practice writing subroutines.

### Preliminary design
The program was initially designed using psuedocode, pictured below:

### Testing methodology
The program was tested using the following test cases:

Required Functionality:
0xef,0xc3,0xc2,0xcb,0xde,0xcd,0xd8,0xd9,0xc0,0xcd,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xdf,0x8d,0x8c,0x8c,0xf5,0xc3,0xd9,0x8c,0xc8,0xc9,0xcf,0xde,0xd5,0xdc,0xd8,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xd8,0xc4,0xc9,0x8c,0xe9,0xef,0xe9,0x9f,0x94,0x9e,0x8c,0xc4,0xc5,0xc8,0xc8,0xc9,0xc2,0x8c,0xc1,0xc9,0xdf,0xdf,0xcd,0xcb,0xc9,0x8c,0xcd,0xc2,0xc8,0x8c,0xcd,0xcf,0xc4,0xc5,0xc9,0xda,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xde,0xc9,0xdd,0xd9,0xc5,0xde,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xca,0xd9,0xc2,0xcf,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xcd,0xc0,0xc5,0xd8,0xd5,0x8f

### Design
Between the psuedocode and my final program, the main change was an alteration in how the message and key were accessed in memory.

### Debugging
Most of the debugging occurred with the determining message and key length from their locations in memory.

### Results
The function was successful for both single and multi-byte keys.

### Observations and Conclusions
Given the intent of the lab, I accomplished most of these goals. With successful implementation of all functions, accompanied with a fair bit of debugging and analysis of memory, I learned a lot about how the different instructions work and how to access and manipulate various parts of memory as well as make subroutines reusable and readable.
