**All answers should be in little-endian, hex format.**

1. (10pts each) For each of the following instructions, identify the addressing modes being used.  For the indicated instructions, write the hand-assembled machine code that corresponds to that instruction.
```
swpb    r7
```
<br>
Addressing mode used for source:
<br>
n/a	
<br>
Addressing mode used for destination:
<br>
register direct
<br>
hand-assembled machine code (**in little-endian, hex format**):
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
xor     @r12+, 0(r6)
```
<br>
Addressing modes used for Source:
<br>
register indirect with post increment
<br>
Addressing mode used for destination:
<br>
indexed
<br>
hand-assembled machine code (**in little-endian, hex format**):
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
nop
```
<br>
Addressing mode used for source:
<br>
n/a
<br>
Addressing mode used for destination:
<br>
n/a
<br>
hand-assembled machine code (**in little-endian, hex format**):
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
mov.w   @r12, &0x0200
```
Addressing mode used for source:
<br>
register indirect
<br>
Addressing mode used for destination:
<br>
absolute
<br>
hand-assembly of `mov @r12, r6`:

<ol start="2">
<li> (5pts) Consider the following code snippet:
```
            jmp     TARGET      ; address is 0xc000
...
TARGET:     nop                 ; address is 0xc024
```
What addressing mode do relative jumps use (if any)?
<br>
<br>
<br>
They use immediate addressing via labels
<br>
<br>
<br>

</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li> (20pts) Consider the following code snippet:
```
mov.w   #0xFF, P1OUT    ;P1OUT is 0x0021
```
<br>
a) (5pts) What addressing modes are being used here?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Addressing mode used for source:
<br>
immediate
<br>
Addressing mode used for destination:
<br>
register direct
<br>

b) (10pts) The programmer wants this code to move 0xFF into P1OUT, but the code isn't working.  Why not?  
*Hint: talk about the assembly / linking process.*
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The code isn't working because the move function is moving the lower bytes of the immediate value.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
c) (5pts) How would you change the code snippet to fix the problem?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To fix the code, I would move #0x00FF into P1OUT.
<br>
<br>

</ol>

</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li> (10pts) Consider the following code snippet:
```
mov.w   r10, @r9
```

a) (5pts) This doesn't assemble.  Why?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The destination cannot be an indirect address.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
b) (5pts) What's an equivalent replacement instruction?
<br>
<br>
<br>
mov.w r10, 0(r9)
<br>
<br>
</ol>

</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li> (5pts)What is the purpose of emulated instructions?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Emulated instructions make code more readable.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<ol start="6">
<li> (20pts)Use the MSP430x2xx Family User's Guide to answer the following questions:

a) (5pts) What status bits does the TST instruction manipulate?
<br>
<br>
The TST instruction manipulates all status bits, clearing V and setting C, with N and Z both variable.
<br>
<br>

b) (10pts) In the example code for the CMP instruction (page 77) what role do the R6 and R7 registers play?
<br>
<br>
<br>
They store the starting address values to compare.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
c) (5pts) In the Digital I/O section, how is it recommended that you should configure unused pins?ï¿½ In your own words, explain why is this course of action recommended.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All unused pins are to be configured as output and left unconnected. This is to ensure there is no unexpected interference with other inputs and keep the pins from using up more power.
