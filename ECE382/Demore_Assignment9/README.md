### **Questions**

**How long of a delay are you using? Explain why you chose the settings you did.**

I am using a 40ms delay in between button presses. I chose this setting to minimize lag in displaying the moving pieces of pong (ball and paddle), while maintaining effective play and preventing button bouncing(physical and virtual).

**How did you test your program to verify that it still worked? Be specific. Describing the various tests you used will get you off to a great start.**

I played pong. I tested the button presses and ensured the desired effect resulted (color change / paddle movement) and verified collision detection on the walls and paddle.
